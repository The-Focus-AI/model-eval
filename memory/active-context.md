## Current Focus
Core model runner implementation is complete, moving to basic CLI implementation phase.

## What's Working
- Core model runner with OpenRouter and Ollama providers (✅ fully tested)
- Cost estimation and calculation (✅ 5 tests passing)
- Rate limit handling with exponential backoff (✅ 7 tests passing)
- Model information and listing (✅ 3 tests passing)
  - Table-based display with sorting and filtering
  - ANSI-aware formatting
  - Provider-specific grouping
- Provider implementations:
  - OpenRouter (✅ 8 tests passing)
  - Ollama (✅ 2 tests passing)
- Environment configuration and API key handling

## Current Implementation Details
- Core Runner Status:
  - All planned features implemented
  - Comprehensive test coverage
  - Error handling and retries working
  - Rate limiting functioning properly
  - Cost tracking implemented

## Test Coverage Status
1. Core Runner (✅ Complete):
   - Model creation and validation
   - Text generation
   - Error handling
   - Rate limiting
   - Cost calculation

2. OpenRouter Provider (✅ Complete):
   - Model creation and validation
   - Text generation
   - Error handling
   - Cost tracking

3. Ollama Provider (✅ Basic Coverage):
   - Basic connectivity
   - Text generation
   - Token usage tracking

## What's Next
1. Begin CLI Implementation:
   - Set up CLI package structure
   - Implement basic run command
   - Add model selection
   - Implement cost display

2. Documentation:
   - Update API documentation
   - Add usage examples
   - Document CLI commands

## Blockers
None currently. Core functionality is tested and working.

## Recent Decisions
1. Moved streaming and function calling to Phase 5 (Advanced Features)
2. Completed core model runner implementation
3. Ready to begin CLI implementation
4. Keeping provider implementations simple using SDK directly

## Technical Debt
1. Add more Ollama provider test coverage
2. Improve error scenario coverage
3. Add performance benchmarking
4. Document provider-specific configurations

## Notes
- All 25 tests passing successfully
- Core functionality is stable and verified
- Ready to begin CLI implementation phase
