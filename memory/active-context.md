# Active Context

## Current Focus
Debugging Google Generative AI API key integration in test suite

## Current Status
- [-] Investigating API key validation issues
- [X] Identified invalid API key in environment
- [X] Verified code is correctly reading environment variables
- [X] Confirmed test suite behavior with mock data

## Current Findings
- API key `AIzaSyBf3FC2xoBaOGZRmvN9a1jYDN_GlWuvcrk` is being rejected by Google's API
- Test suite correctly uses mock data with `test-key`
- Environment variables are being loaded properly from `.env` file
- 12 tests passing, 3 failing due to invalid API key

## Next Steps
1. Generate new valid Google Generative AI API key
2. Update `.env` file with new key
3. Re-run tests to verify text generation functionality

## Blockers
- [!] Need valid Google Generative AI API key
- [!] Need to verify API key has correct permissions for Gemini API

## Recent Decisions
- Confirmed that the test suite should skip text generation tests when using mock data
- Verified that the environment variable naming is correct (`GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`)

### In Progress
- Adding Google provider support using @google/generative-ai v0.24.0
- Implementing dynamic model listing instead of hardcoded models
- Fixing TypeScript linting issues in Google provider implementation

### Dependencies Update Status
Current core dependencies (all at latest versions):
- @google/generative-ai: ^0.24.0 (Latest)
- @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider: ^0.4.3 (Latest)
- ollama-ai-provider: ^1.2.0 (Latest)
- ai: ^4.1.46
- zod: ^3.22.4

### Next Steps
1. Fix TypeScript linting issues in Google provider:
   - Add proper type declarations for @google/generative-ai
   - Fix LanguageModelV1 interface compatibility
   - Add proper type annotations for parameters
2. Test Google provider implementation
3. Update documentation with Google provider setup instructions

### Blockers
- Need to resolve TypeScript type issues with the Google Generative AI SDK
- Need to verify token counting and cost calculation for Google models

### Recent Decisions
1. Switched to dynamic model listing using API endpoints instead of hardcoded lists
2. Using latest @google/generative-ai SDK (v0.24.0) for better features and stability
3. Added Google as a third provider option alongside OpenRouter and Ollama
4. Verified all dependencies are at their latest versions
