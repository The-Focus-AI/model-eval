## Current Stage
Phase 1: Core Model Runner implementation

## What's Being Worked On
- [X] Project brief review completed
- [X] Project plan created with phased approach
- [X] Detailed evaluation framework designed
- [-] Core Model Runner implementation
  - [X] Basic structure and types
  - [X] OpenRouter provider
  - [-] Tests and error handling
    - [X] Basic test infrastructure with Vitest
    - [X] Cost calculation tests
    - [X] Model listing tests
    - [X] Ollama provider integration tests
    - [ ] OpenRouter provider integration tests
    - [ ] Error handling tests
    - [ ] Stream handling tests
    - [ ] Complex prompt tests

## Next Steps
1. Implement OpenRouter provider integration tests
2. Add comprehensive error handling tests
3. Implement stream handling tests
4. Add complex prompt and chat completion tests
5. Implement retry mechanism for transient errors

## Blockers
- Need to verify API key availability for model providers
- Need to confirm specific model providers to support initially
- Need to determine which models will be used for evaluation
- Need to establish evaluation cost budget and optimization strategies

## Recent Decisions
1. Using Vitest instead of Jest for testing framework
2. Test coverage shows good progress on cost management and basic provider integration
3. Identified gaps in test coverage for error handling and advanced features
4. Ollama integration tests are working with local instance

## Test Status
- Total test files: 3
- Total tests: 10 (all passing)
- Current coverage:
  - Cost calculation and formatting ✓
  - Model listing (Ollama & OpenRouter) ✓
  - Basic text generation (Ollama) ✓
  - Token usage tracking ✓

## Current Focus: Cost Management Implementation

### Overview
Implementing cost estimation and tracking capabilities for model usage across different providers.

### Currently Working On
- Core cost estimation module completed
- Test suite verified
- Documentation updated

### Next Steps
1. Consider implementing cost aggregation across multiple requests
2. Add budget management features
3. Develop token estimation from text length
4. Add cost optimization suggestions

### Blockers
None currently

### Recent Decisions
- Using per-1K token pricing model
- Separating prompt and completion costs
- Returning null for free models
- Using 6 decimal places for cost precision

### Implementation Notes
- Cost calculation functions are non-throwing
- Type-safe interfaces throughout
- Provider-specific pricing handled via model metadata
- Basic test infrastructure is working well
- Local Ollama instance is properly configured and responding
- OpenRouter API integration is functional for model listing
