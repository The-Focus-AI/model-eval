## Current Focus
Completing Phase 1 core model runner implementation, with rate limit handling now implemented and tested.

## What's Working
- Core model runner with OpenRouter and Ollama providers
- Cost estimation and calculation
- Rate limit handling with exponential backoff
- Test suite with high coverage
- Model switching capability (successfully switched to Mistral model)

## Current Implementation Details
- Rate limit handling module (`rate-limit.ts`):
  - State tracking per model
  - Exponential backoff with jitter
  - Request rate monitoring
  - Header parsing support
- Model runner integration:
  - Automatic rate limit checks
  - Retry mechanism with backoff
  - Error classification and handling

## What's Next
1. CLI Implementation
   - Design command structure
   - Implement basic prompt execution
   - Add result display formatting

2. Documentation
   - Document rate limit handling behavior
   - Create usage examples
   - Update API documentation

## Blockers
None currently. All critical functionality is implemented and tested.

## Recent Decisions
1. Switched from Gemini to Mistral model for testing due to rate limits
2. Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for rate limit handling
3. Added comprehensive test suite for rate limit functionality

## Test Status
- Total test files: 5
- Total tests: 25 (all passing)
- Current coverage:
  - Cost calculation and formatting ✓
  - Model listing (Ollama & OpenRouter) ✓
  - Basic text generation (Ollama) ✓
  - Token usage tracking ✓
  - OpenRouter model creation ✓
  - OpenRouter error handling ✓
  - Rate limit handling ✓
  - Model switching ✓

## Technical Debt
1. Need to implement provider-specific rate limit header parsing
2. Consider adding rate limit prediction based on usage patterns
3. May need to add more sophisticated retry strategies

## Notes
- All tests are passing with good coverage
- Rate limit handling is working well in tests
- Core functionality is stable and reliable
