## Current Stage
Phase 1: Core Model Runner implementation

## What's Being Worked On
- [X] Project brief review completed
- [X] Project plan created with phased approach
- [X] Detailed evaluation framework designed
- [-] Core Model Runner implementation
  - [X] Basic structure and types
  - [X] OpenRouter provider
  - [ ] Tests and error handling

## Next Steps
1. Create Jest configuration for core package
2. Write tests for:
   - Base model runner
   - OpenRouter provider
   - Type validations
3. Implement retry mechanism for transient errors
4. Add proper error classification

## Blockers
- Need to verify API key availability for model providers
- Need to confirm specific model providers to support initially
- Need to determine which models will be used for evaluation
- Need to establish evaluation cost budget and optimization strategies

## Recent Decisions
1. Adopted a phased approach prioritizing high-risk components first
2. Structured project as a monorepo using pnpm workspaces
3. Implemented core model runner before storage to validate basic functionality
4. Using Jest for testing framework
5. OpenRouter as first provider implementation

## Current Focus: Cost Management Implementation

### Overview
Implementing cost estimation and tracking capabilities for model usage across different providers.

### Currently Working On
- Core cost estimation module completed
- Test suite verified
- Documentation updated

### Next Steps
1. Consider implementing cost aggregation across multiple requests
2. Add budget management features
3. Develop token estimation from text length
4. Add cost optimization suggestions

### Blockers
None currently

### Recent Decisions
- Using per-1K token pricing model
- Separating prompt and completion costs
- Returning null for free models
- Using 6 decimal places for cost precision

### Implementation Notes
- Cost calculation functions are non-throwing
- Type-safe interfaces throughout
- Provider-specific pricing handled via model metadata
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
