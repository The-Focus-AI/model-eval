## Current Focus
Expanding test coverage and implementing advanced features, with core functionality verified and stable.

## What's Working
- Core model runner with OpenRouter and Ollama providers (✅ fully tested)
- Cost estimation and calculation (✅ 5 tests passing)
- Rate limit handling with exponential backoff (✅ 7 tests passing)
- Model information and listing (✅ 3 tests passing)
  - Table-based display with sorting and filtering
  - ANSI-aware formatting
  - Provider-specific grouping
- Provider implementations:
  - OpenRouter (✅ 8 tests passing)
  - Ollama (✅ 2 tests passing)
- Environment configuration and API key handling

## Current Implementation Details
- CLI Improvements:
  - Enhanced model listing with table format
  - Sorting by name, context length, and cost
  - Filtering by provider and cost (free/paid)
  - Color-coded output with proper alignment
- Rate limit handling module (`src/rate-limit/rate-limit.ts`):
  - State tracking per model
  - Exponential backoff with jitter
  - Request rate monitoring
  - Header parsing support
- Model runner integration:
  - Automatic rate limit checks
  - Retry mechanism with backoff
  - Error classification and handling
- Test Organization:
  - Tests colocated with source files
  - Feature-based directory structure
  - Centralized test utilities
  - Environment configuration working

## Test Coverage Status
1. Cost Calculation (✅ Complete):
   - Estimates and actual calculations
   - Free vs paid model handling
   - Cost breakdown formatting
   - Token usage tracking

2. Rate Limiting (✅ Complete):
   - Request allowance checks
   - Exponential backoff
   - State management
   - Header parsing

3. Model Information (✅ Complete):
   - Model listing and validation
   - Cost information handling
   - Provider-specific details
   - Model capabilities

4. OpenRouter Provider (✅ Complete):
   - Model creation and validation
   - Text generation
   - Temperature control
   - Error handling
   - Conversation handling

5. Ollama Provider (✅ Basic Coverage):
   - Basic connectivity
   - Text generation
   - Token usage tracking

## What's Next
1. Advanced Feature Implementation:
   - Streaming support
   - Function calling capabilities
   - System message handling
   - Concurrent request management

2. Test Coverage Expansion:
   - Streaming response tests
   - Concurrent request handling
   - Advanced error scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks

3. Documentation:
   - Update API documentation
   - Add usage examples
   - Document advanced features

## Blockers
None currently. All core functionality is tested and working.

## Recent Decisions
1. Verified all core functionality with comprehensive tests
2. Completed model listing CLI with enhanced formatting
3. Confirmed OpenRouter API integration working
4. Validated both provider implementations
5. Standardized on technical model IDs for clarity

## Technical Debt
1. Add streaming support tests
2. Implement concurrent request handling
3. Expand Ollama provider test coverage
4. Add performance benchmarking
5. Implement advanced error scenarios
6. Verify and fix Ollama model context lengths
7. Consider adding model capability information to verbose output

## Notes
- All 25 tests passing successfully
- Core functionality is stable and verified
- CLI formatting improved with proper table display
- Ready to implement advanced features
