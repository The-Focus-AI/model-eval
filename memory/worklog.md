### Notes
- Need to better understand AI SDK type system
- Consider contributing type definitions upstream
- May need to implement custom stream handling
- Should document provider-specific requirements

## 2025-03-26 00:15:00 EDT - Major Simplification of Provider Implementation

### Summary
Dramatically simplified the provider implementations by directly using the Vercel AI SDK providers.

### Accomplishments
1. Removed custom provider implementations in favor of direct SDK usage
2. Updated dependencies to latest versions:
   - @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider: ^0.4.3
   - ollama-ai-provider: ^1.2.0
   - ai: ^4.1.46
3. Created simple factory functions that return LanguageModelV1 instances
4. Removed unnecessary abstraction layers and custom types

### Decisions Made
1. Use Vercel AI SDK types directly (LanguageModelV1)
2. Keep provider implementations as simple as possible
3. Let the SDK handle all the complexity of model interactions
4. Remove custom abstractions that weren't adding value

### Technical Details
- Provider implementations reduced to just factory functions:
  ```typescript
  // Ollama
  export function createOllamaModel(modelName: string): LanguageModelV1 {
    return ollama(modelName)
  }

  // OpenRouter
  export function createOpenRouterModel(modelName: string): LanguageModelV1 {
    return openrouter(modelName)
  }
  ```

### Next Actions
1. Add example usage documentation
2. Implement basic tests
3. Add provider configuration options if needed
4. Update the model runner to use the simplified providers

### Notes
- The simplified approach makes the code much more maintainable
- Direct SDK usage provides better type safety and future compatibility
- Removed unnecessary abstraction layers that were adding complexity

## Cost Estimation Implementation (2024-03-26)

### Summary
Implemented a comprehensive cost estimation and calculation system for model usage.

### Accomplishments
- Created `costs.ts` module with cost estimation and calculation utilities
- Implemented three main functions:
  - `estimateCost`: Pre-execution cost prediction
  - `calculateCost`: Post-execution cost calculation
  - `formatCostBreakdown`: Human-readable cost formatting
- Added comprehensive test suite in `costs.test.ts`
- Verified functionality with both paid (OpenRouter) and free (Ollama) models

### Decisions
- Used per-1K token pricing model for consistency with industry standards
- Separated prompt and completion token costs for detailed tracking
- Made cost calculation functions return null for free models instead of zero costs
- Used 6 decimal places for cost display to account for micro-transactions

### Next Steps
- Consider adding cost tracking/aggregation over multiple requests
- Potential future addition of budget management features
- May need token estimation based on text length in the future 

## 2025-03-25 20:20:06 EDT - Test Infrastructure Review and Status Update

### Summary

- Confirmed Vitest is properly configured and running
- Identified current test coverage areas:
  - Cost calculation and formatting
  - Model listing from both providers
  - Basic text generation with Ollama
  - Token usage tracking
- Identified gaps in test coverage:
  - OpenRouter provider integration
  - Error handling scenarios
  - Stream handling
  - Complex prompts and chat completion

### Decisions
- Continue using Vitest as testing framework
- Prioritize OpenRouter provider integration tests
- Plan to add comprehensive error handling tests
- Need to implement stream handling tests

### Next Actions
1. Implement stream handling tests
