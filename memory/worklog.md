- ModelProvider interface simplified to focus on capabilities and metadata
- ModelRunner now handles all execution through generateText
- Standardized response handling across all providers
- Improved error handling and retry mechanism
- Better token usage calculation and cost tracking

### Decisions Made
1. Moved execution responsibility entirely to ModelRunner
2. Using Vercel AI SDK's generateText as the standard execution method
3. Standardized response format across all providers
4. Improved error handling with retries
5. Enhanced token usage calculation

### Next Steps
1. Update provider implementations to match new interface
2. Add comprehensive test suite for new components
3. Update documentation with new patterns
4. Verify all providers work with new execution flow
