## 2025-03-25 19:34:18 EDT - Core Model Runner Implementation

### Summary
Implemented the initial version of the core model runner with OpenRouter provider integration.

### Accomplishments
1. Set up monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces
2. Created core package with TypeScript configuration
3. Implemented base interfaces and types for model interaction
4. Created OpenRouter provider implementation
5. Set up basic project structure and documentation

### Decisions Made
1. Using pnpm for package management
2. TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
3. Zod for runtime type validation
4. Vitest for testing framework
5. OpenRouter as first provider implementation

- Core Dependencies:
  - ai: ^4.2.5
  - @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider: ^1.0.0
  - ollama-ai-provider: ^1.0.0
  - zod: ^3.22.4

### Next Actions
1. Create Vitest configuration and test suite
2. Implement retry mechanism for API calls
3. Add proper error classification and handling
4. Begin CLI implementation

### Notes
- Need to verify API key handling and security
- Consider adding rate limiting and request queuing
- May need to adjust token usage tracking per provider

## 2025-03-25 20:30:00 EDT - Provider Implementation Updates

### Summary
Added Ollama provider implementation and updated OpenRouter to use Vercel AI SDK providers.

### Accomplishments
1. Added OpenRouter provider using @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider
2. Implemented Ollama provider using ollama-ai-provider
3. Updated dependencies to use Vercel AI SDK providers
4. Standardized provider interfaces

### Decisions Made
1. Using community-maintained Vercel AI SDK providers
2. Standardized streaming implementation across providers
3. Consistent error handling approach
4. Token usage tracking standardization

### Technical Details
- Updated Dependencies:
  - Added: @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider ^1.0.0
  - Added: ollama-ai-provider ^1.0.0
  - Core: ai ^4.2.5

### Next Actions
1. Add type definitions for providers
2. Implement provider-specific error handling
3. Add provider capability detection
4. Create provider configuration system

### Notes
- Need to verify provider compatibility
- Consider adding provider-specific rate limiting
- May need to implement provider-specific token counting
- Should document provider-specific configuration options

## 2025-03-25 21:00:00 EDT - Vercel AI SDK Integration

### Summary
Updated the implementation to use Vercel AI SDK's core functionality for text generation and streaming.

### Accomplishments
1. Simplified provider implementation using Vercel AI SDK
2. Implemented text generation with generateText
3. Added streaming support with streamText
4. Updated type definitions for better SDK compatibility

### Decisions Made
1. Using Vercel AI SDK's core functions directly
2. Simplified model options interface
3. Handling API authentication via headers
4. Temporary type assertions for SDK compatibility

### Technical Details
- Updated Dependencies:
  - Using ai ^4.2.5 for core functionality
  - Removed provider-specific SDKs
  - Simplified type definitions

### Next Actions
1. Resolve type compatibility issues with AI SDK
2. Add proper error handling for API responses
3. Implement proper stream handling
4. Add provider-specific configuration options

### Notes
- Need to better understand AI SDK type system
- Consider contributing type definitions upstream
- May need to implement custom stream handling
- Should document provider-specific requirements

## 2025-03-26 00:15:00 EDT - Major Simplification of Provider Implementation

### Summary
Dramatically simplified the provider implementations by directly using the Vercel AI SDK providers.

### Accomplishments
1. Removed custom provider implementations in favor of direct SDK usage
2. Updated dependencies to latest versions:
   - @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider: ^0.4.3
   - ollama-ai-provider: ^1.2.0
   - ai: ^4.1.46
3. Created simple factory functions that return LanguageModelV1 instances
4. Removed unnecessary abstraction layers and custom types

### Decisions Made
1. Use Vercel AI SDK types directly (LanguageModelV1)
2. Keep provider implementations as simple as possible
3. Let the SDK handle all the complexity of model interactions
4. Remove custom abstractions that weren't adding value

### Technical Details
- Provider implementations reduced to just factory functions:
  ```typescript
  // Ollama
  export function createOllamaModel(modelName: string): LanguageModelV1 {
    return ollama(modelName)
  }

  // OpenRouter
  export function createOpenRouterModel(modelName: string): LanguageModelV1 {
    return openrouter(modelName)
  }
  ```

### Next Actions
1. Add example usage documentation
2. Implement basic tests
3. Add provider configuration options if needed
4. Update the model runner to use the simplified providers

### Notes
- The simplified approach makes the code much more maintainable
- Direct SDK usage provides better type safety and future compatibility
- Removed unnecessary abstraction layers that were adding complexity

## Cost Estimation Implementation (2024-03-26)

### Summary
Implemented a comprehensive cost estimation and calculation system for model usage.

### Accomplishments
- Created `costs.ts` module with cost estimation and calculation utilities
- Implemented three main functions:
  - `estimateCost`: Pre-execution cost prediction
  - `calculateCost`: Post-execution cost calculation
  - `formatCostBreakdown`: Human-readable cost formatting
- Added comprehensive test suite in `costs.test.ts`
- Verified functionality with both paid (OpenRouter) and free (Ollama) models

### Decisions
- Used per-1K token pricing model for consistency with industry standards
- Separated prompt and completion token costs for detailed tracking
- Made cost calculation functions return null for free models instead of zero costs
- Used 6 decimal places for cost display to account for micro-transactions

### Next Steps
- Consider adding cost tracking/aggregation over multiple requests
- Potential future addition of budget management features
- May need token estimation based on text length in the future
