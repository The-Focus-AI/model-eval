## 2025-03-26 00:15:00 EDT - Major Simplification of Provider Implementation

### Summary
Dramatically simplified the provider implementations by directly using the Vercel AI SDK providers.

### Accomplishments
1. Removed custom provider implementations in favor of direct SDK usage
2. Updated dependencies to latest versions:
   - @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider: ^0.4.3
   - ollama-ai-provider: ^1.2.0
   - ai: ^4.1.46
3. Created simple factory functions that return LanguageModelV1 instances
4. Removed unnecessary abstraction layers and custom types

### Decisions Made
1. Use Vercel AI SDK types directly (LanguageModelV1)
2. Keep provider implementations as simple as possible
3. Let the SDK handle all the complexity of model interactions
4. Remove custom abstractions that weren't adding value

### Technical Details
- Provider implementations reduced to just factory functions:
  ```typescript
  // Ollama
  export function createOllamaModel(modelName: string): LanguageModelV1 {
    return ollama(modelName)
  }

  // OpenRouter
  export function createOpenRouterModel(modelName: string): LanguageModelV1 {
    return openrouter(modelName)
  }
  ```

### Next Actions
1. Add example usage documentation
2. Implement basic tests
3. Add provider configuration options if needed
4. Update the model runner to use the simplified providers

### Notes
- The simplified approach makes the code much more maintainable
